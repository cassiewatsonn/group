A reminder app that keeps track of important tasks

As a student, I want to stay organized and see a layout of my day hour by hour and recieve a reminder 30 minutes prior to a class or activity. so that, I can stay on top of assignments and classes. 


A mobile application that finds nearby restaurants 

As a foodie, I want to be able to see nearby restaurants. I want to see the ratings and price scale of the restaurants. so that, I can attend a quality restuarant within my budget.
